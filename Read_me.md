**E-Commerce Sales Data Analysis \& Wrangling Pipeline (Python)**



**​Objective**: Designed and executed a complete data analysis pipeline using a raw sales dataset (sales\_data.csv) to perform data quality checks, feature engineering, and advanced querying.



**Core Technical Skills:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy.

​**Analytical Techniques:** Feature Engineering, Statistical Analysis, Correlation.

​**Data Handling:** Data Cleaning, Conditional Indexing (.loc), Data Sorting.





**​Action:**

* ​Utilized Python libraries Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for the entire workflow.
* ​Performed comprehensive Data Wrangling, including loading, structure inspection (.shape, .info()), and statistical profiling (.describe()).
* ​Executed Feature Engineering by creating new, analytical metrics such as 'Revenue\_per\_Head' and 'Calculated\_Cost' (Unit\_Cost \* Order\_Quantity).
* ​Applied complex conditional filtering using the .loc indexer to answer specific business questions (e.g., isolating all sales of the 'Bikes' category and querying the number of male customers with revenue >= 500).
* ​Simulated a real-world scenario by programmatically increasing the 'Unit\_Price' by 1.3.



​**Result:** Generated key visualizations (Box Plots, Histograms, Scatter Plots, Pie Charts) and quantitative reports (Correlation Matrix, Top 10 Sales by Revenue) to identify high-value customer segments and top-performing product categories.
